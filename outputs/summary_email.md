# Executive Summary
**Executive Summary**  
In 2024-Q1, the company faced an early warning of growth deceleration as revenue contracted by 3.28% QoQ to $590,000. This decline coincided with a marginal decline in gross margin to 45.76%, while CAC rose 8.47% to $261.82, indicating escalating customer acquisition costs putting pressure on profitability. Net contribution fell sharply by 8.45% to $130,000, reflecting the combined effects of slowing sales and cost inflation. Importantly, new customer acquisition slipped 5.17% and churn increased 5.56%, intensifying the risk of revenue erosion from customer turnover. The detection of anomalous patterns by the Isolation Forest model signals unusual operating conditions or market disruptions, reinforcing the urgency for deeper diagnostic efforts. Collectively, these indicators demand immediate cross-functional action to optimize customer acquisition spend, enhance retention, and uncover the root causes of these anomalies to arrest margin deterioration and restore growth momentum.
